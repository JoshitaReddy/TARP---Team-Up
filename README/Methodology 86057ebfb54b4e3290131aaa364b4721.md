# Methodology

We will be building a website where students can predict their careers and predict the expected amount of salary in their chosen field.

# The different steps of the project include:

- Student career prediction ML model
- Student salary prediction ML model
- Website Frontend
- Website Backend
- Integration
- Testing
- Student career prediction ML model

# Steps:

1. **Student career prediction ML model**
    1. The dataset for the ML model is chosen from the following link
        
        [career-prediction-database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipulr16/career-prediction-database)
        
    2. Student career prediction is identified as a classification problem, as there are different classes of potential job roles that will be predicted as an output.
    3. Data preprocessing of the dataset is to be performed by
        1. Identifying and handling missing values by substituting with mean, most frequent values, etc.
        2. Encode the categorical data.
        3. Split the dataset
        4. Perform feature scaling to ensure that all the values are in the same range.
    4. There are 5 classification algorithms in ML
        1. Logistic Regression.
        2. Naive Bayes.
        3. K-Nearest Neighbors.
        4. Decision Tree.
        5. Support Vector Machines.
        
        Each of the above algorithms will be performed to determine the algorithm that provides the best accuracy.
        
    5. The algorithm chosen from the previous step will be chosen to test sample data and predict a student’s career.
        
        
2. **Student salary prediction ML model**
    1. The dataset for the ML model is chosen from the following link 
        
        [engineering-graduate-salary-prediction ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/engineering-graduate-salary-prediction )
        
    2. Student salary prediction is identified as a regression problem, as each student will get a unique salary based on the user input.
    3. Data preprocessing of the dataset is to be performed by
        1. Identifying and handling missing values by substituting with mean, most frequent values, etc.
        2. Encode the categorical data.
        3. Split the dataset
        4. Perform feature scaling to ensure that all the values are in the same range.
    4. There are 4 regression algorithms that will be used:
        1. Linear Regression.
        2. Logistic Regression.
        3. Polynomial Regression.
        4. Bayesian Linear Regression.
        
        Each of the above algorithms will be performed to determine the algorithm that provides the best accuracy.
        
    5. The algorithm chosen from the previous step will be chosen to test sample data and predict a student’s expected salary.
    
3.  **Website Frontend**
    1. The website front-end will be coded in React JS by following the design made in Figma in the following link
        
        [career.ly?node-id=0%3A1&t=ieL8y0x8zKZE4yQk-1 ](https://www.figma.com/file/xsl40eQhnCPUPg0dOwEpkU/career.ly?node-id=0%3A1&t=ieL8y0x8zKZE4yQk-1 )
        
    2. React-JS follows the following lifecycle of methods
        1. Initialization
        2. Mounting
        3. Updating
        4. Unmounting

4. **Website Backend**
    1. Require different necessary libraries
    2. Define the required GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions based on the requirements.
    3. Define the port on which the server listens.
    
5. **Integration**
    1. The previously written ML models need to be converted in the form of a python object into a character stream using pickling.
    2. We need to build an API using Flask.
    3. The output after building the API will be 2 links of each of the ML models which can be integrated with our website backend.
    4. The links are put in the required GET routes to access the prediction models.
    5. The functionality of the website is now complete, and the website can be hosted to make it accessible to everyone.
    
6. **Testing**
    1. After the completion of the website testing needs to be performed to ensure that the platform works as per the requirements
    2. The different testing methodologies that will be employed are:
        1. Functionality testing: This step ensures that the functionalities of a web application are properly functioning or not.
        2. Usability testing: Usability testing involves several parameters such as UI design, speed, navigability, content readability, and accessibility.
        3. Interface testing: This testing method ensures that the three main components of a web application which are the web server, web browser, and database are running harmoniously.
        4. Compatibility testing: This testing methodology ensures that a particular web application is compatible with all browsers.
        5. Performance testing: The web application is tested in terms of how better it can perform under stress conditions and heavy load.
        6. Security testing: To ensure the security of the data provided by users is safely stored.
