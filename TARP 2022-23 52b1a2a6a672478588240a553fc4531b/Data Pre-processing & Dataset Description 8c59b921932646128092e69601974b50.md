# Data Pre-processing & Dataset Description

## Data Preprocessing

**Data pre-processing** refers to the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data so that it can be used for analysis. The goal of data pre-processing is to convert raw data into a format that is more usable and insightful for data analysis.

Some common steps in data pre-processing include handling missing or incomplete data, removing duplicated data, normalizing or standardizing data, handling categorical data, handling outliers, and feature selection or extraction.

- **Handling missing or incomplete data** involves identifying any missing or incomplete data points and deciding how to handle them, such as deleting them, filling in the missing values, or using a statistical method to impute them.
- **Removing duplicated data** involves identifying any duplicated data points and deciding how to handle them, such as deleting them or averaging the values.
- **Normalizing or standardizing data** involves scaling the data so that it falls within a certain range, which can reduce the impact of outliers and make the data more comparable.
- **Handling categorical data** involves converting it into a numerical format that can be used in analysis, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Handling outliers** involves identifying data points that fall far outside of the typical range of values for a dataset and handling them appropriately.
- **Feature selection or extraction** involves identifying the most important features in a dataset and selecting or extracting them for use in analysis, which can help to reduce complexity and improve accuracy.
- **Split the data into training and test set**, such that, we can train our model on the training set and then evaluate its performance on the test set. This allows us to estimate how well our model will perform on new, unseen data.
- **Now, the data is ready for for model creation & prediction.**

For the Career Prediction Database and Engineering Graduate Salary Prediction datasets, the specific steps taken during data pre-processing may vary depending on the analysis being performed and the specific needs of the model being built. It is important to carefully consider the data pre-processing steps to ensure that the data is accurate, reliable, and suitable for analysis.
