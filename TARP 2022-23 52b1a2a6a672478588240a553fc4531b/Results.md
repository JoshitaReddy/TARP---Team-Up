# Results & Discussions

Two discrete models were trained, namely a classification
model and a regression model. Both models were utilised to
formulate predictions. The study employed a dataset sourced
from Kaggle, containing career prediction data, to construct
a classification model. The efficacy of various classification
algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree,
random forest, and support vector classifier, was subsequently
evaluated. The support vector classifier demonstrated superior
performance on the testing set, attaining an accuracy of
86 and an F1 score of 80. The support vector classifier
was identified as the optimal model. This methodology can
accurately predict the professional trajectories of students by
analysing their current skill sets.
The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various
regression techniques, namely linear regression, polynomial
regression, and XGBoost, through the utilisation of a salary
dataset in constructing the regression model. The XGBoost
model exhibited superior performance compared to other models on the testing set, as evidenced by its R-squared value
of 0.85. This methodology enables a job seeker to acquire a
precise estimation of the potential income they could receive.
Both models exhibited commendable performance on their
respective datasets and possess the potential to be valuable in
forecasting forthcoming career trajectories and remunerations.
The website’s users possess the capability to input relevant
characteristics and obtain anticipated results derived from the
model, thereby aiding in the process of making well-informed
decisions.

On this website, we have presented a classification model
predicting the student’s career and a regression model that
predicts the expected salary that a student should expect.
The models were trained and evaluated using accuracy and
R squared metrics. Our results indicate that the model can
precisely predict the salary and the career of the student based
on the input features. Students can fill out the forms and
get career or salary predictions, which can help them make
informed decisions about their professional life. The website is
designed to provide maximum information to students which
will help them analyze all aspects in a better way. As part
of our future works, more algorithms, such as deep learning
models, can be considered to increase the accuracy of the
suggested system. Further research is required to determine
how better career choice predictions relate to job outcomes,
particularly those measured over time
